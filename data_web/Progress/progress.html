            <h4>*Keypoints</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I have removed some files that I found to be inconvienent and incompatible because restyling them would be a useless workload</li>
                <li>However, I did find better design to my tastes and even learned more complex features of Javascript</li>
                <li>Things that I'm learning at the moment: </li>
                <ol>
                    <li>DOM manipulation, I have learned how to add, remove, and modify elements on the web page. I am currently working on a list program until I feel satisfied with the project</li>
                    <li>I have also experimented with iterators and looping. I have a basic understanding but hopefully I can find projects that will use this heavily so I can gain a profiency for it. Maybe a mutual friends thing?</li>
                    <li>Better, faster, and streamlined design. I have no clue on whether my design looks good, but I'll do my best to make it look better and unified. Other than that, I found out that you can link multiple CSS files to one html page, so I can have a general CSS file for general design, and then create a second one for specific design for that page. This helps a lot, especially since I plan to implement the navigation to every page. </li>
                    <li>I will be able to update the design for the working part of my project, but the other two projects will still have to be withheld</li>
                </ol>

                
                <li> Things I want to get done by the end of this year:  </li>
                <ol>
                    <li>An updated design making the web experience smoother</li>
                    <li>Adding an about me page where I'll show what I aspire to be and what I'm doing now.</li>
                    <li>Add more projects that involve the coding cycle.</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
