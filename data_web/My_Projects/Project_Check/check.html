           <p>This is a page for calculating checks and will give daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly salaries based on amount of hours worked for each day worked.</p>
           <p>The question will be asked for hours and days, it will then give a table that will show the previously mentioned salaries, also options to reset these records are optional, and maybe implement a way to compare two different sets.</p>
