            <h4>*Keypoints after June</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm now in college, so I'll be extremely busy with my studies.</li>
                <li>On top of that, my job will also take time from my schedule.</li>
                <li>However, this does not discourage me from still updating my website, I'll continue to add in more projects that I am able to build with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Also,  I'll continue to explore the more complex aspects of javascript.</li>
                <li>By the end of this year, I want to be able to have a plethora of projects under my belt for web development, or at least show experience in coding, although, they may be easy to an expert programmer, I'll at least have more experience.</li>
                <li>Along with that, I want to expand my knowledge of programming onto other coding languages so it's possible that this site may be dormant for a while if I find the time to do other projects.</li>
                <ol> Things I want to get done by the end of this year:
                    <li>An updated design making the web experience smoother</li>
                    <li>Adding an about me page where I'll show what I aspire to be and what I'm doing now.</li>
                    <li>Add more projects that involve the coding cycle.</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
