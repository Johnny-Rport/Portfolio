# Portfolio Website
This is my first iteration of my portfolio website, I mostly messed around with it to explore the concepts of HTML, CSS, and most importantly Javascript. I believe I have enough understanding to start branching into other frameworks and tools like React or Vue. I plan to create a React iteration of this website and to completely remake my portfolio website. I will also make use of the repository system in github to make other projects larger than the small projects I did in my portfolio website. Until I have a complete understanding of coding I will keep reiterating my website until it is of prime quality. 

I also just want to archive this project since it only uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Anyhoo [Here's the link to my website](https://johnnyportfolio.dev/)
