            <h1>What is this website you may ask?</h1> <!--First Description-->
            <article> 
                <p>This was my first project within the field of coding, these pages were purely made from scratch with html and CSS</p>
                <p>This is the home page that will lead to the other pages that will either go next or link back to this page. This home page is modeled after my older brother's personal blog and my high school's home page within their websites. <a href="https://raulingaverage.dev/" target="_blank">Here is my older brother's blog, he inspired me to do coding. </a> <a href="https://cvhsweb.ceres.k12.ca.us/" target="blank" style="color: red">Here is my high school's home page that I will model this home page after.</a></p>
                <p>This is my first project, which will contain any other projects that I may think of and store them here.</p>
                <p>I plan to implement more advanced a smooth looking transitions and see if I can figure out how to use javascript to my advantage here.</p><p>Well that's the end of this description just practicing using the article tag within html as well as paragraph tags because I mostly used the list tags within the other pages which are about my future.</p>
            </article>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Links</h1> <!--Second Description-->
            <article>
                <div>
                    <p>Now at the time of typing this paragraph I have successfully added a navigation bar with a animations and have the knowledge to change its appearance. Hopefully, by the time you're reading this I would have many more links to other projects I may have created. I think I know what this website would become, an archive of some sore where I experiment with and this home page will be the hub that connects all of my future projects. Very nice.</p>
                    <p>I guess I will elaborate the links that I have implmented into the next paragraphs.</p>
                </div>
                <div> <!--My Goals-->
                    <h2>My Goals</h2>
                        <p>This is a categorey containing the first four webpages under the name of "My Goals" in the navigation bar. I have created that were mostly focused on refining my ability to implement code. I have had a successful experience just coding and adding on to what was supposed to be a "hello world!" program. It contains the following: Beginnings, Plans, Resume, and College. I will describe them in the next four sections in more detail, but essentially it is what I was thinking at the time of typing the code. Also, the descriptions show when the buttons are pressed.</p>
                        <section>
                            <h3> <button id="des_button" onclick="showy(des)">-</button>Beginnings</h3>
                                <p class="hide" valueAsDes0>So this was what I wrote and began to code immediately after getting my "hello world" program to work. Obviously, my first language is html so I understand basic coding and completely understand html to the point where I can create this website. I am getting more comfortable with css as well and as you can see, I am getting better at it as when comparing this page and the first page it is a marginal difference. 
                                <br> <br> I was thinking about what to do with the page because at the time I have created and successly added style to my first three pages and frankly they're quite bland in my opinion. However, that did not scare me to not learning more about coding and as I previously said I plan to turn this into an offical website where I store my projects into one hub. I believe my portfolio website once it is built will contain a link to this homepage. So basically I plan to build two seperate websites and linking one to the other for portfolio purposes. What will I do once I'm satisfied with my website? Well, I plan to add functionality to the website, like adding Javascript on here. I mostly plan to do small Javascript games like maybe tic tac toe as a starter and then moving from there.
                                <br> <br>Next within the page I then talk about my future, specifically college and my motives for doing so. So the major I will be taking to get a foot hold within the computing industry is Computer Science which as described within the page is just a set of classes that gives me a fancy degree to get more money. At this very moment, I am researching about the major and have found that it is just that, the school will not teach me everything about coding and how to get a stable career, so I will have to do it myself. I also noted the langauges they might use and the type of class it is, which is math heavy and I generally like math so hopefully the formulas aren't too complicated.
                                <br> <br>In the same page, I also talk about the languages I plan to learn in the future. I planned to learn html, css, and C++ for educational purposes. I am nearing the limits of both the html and css languages in terms of content, although I know most of their attributes and selections by heart I still cannot create cohesive websites without more experience, which is where implenting my newer projects into my this hub will be for (practice basically). </p>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <h3> <button id="des_button" onclick="showy(des1)">-</button> Plans</h3>
                                <p class="hide" valueAsDes1>Here I begin list out my plans for the next three months starting in September. I have already completed most of my goals except for a few like knowing C++ or having an income at the time of 10/24/2020. However, my main goal to become comfortable with HTML, CSS, and Javascript was one of my most important goals and have been completed. I know enough html to type this paragraph and all the other text, and know enough CSS to achieve some form of style, as well creating button functions through Javascript, hopefully I had already created my next Javascript project by the time you're reading this.</p>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <h3><button id="des_button" onclick="showy(des2)">-</button> Resume</h3>
                                <p class="hide" valueAsDes2>So within my resume page I talk about what I would need to put into my resume when I was about 17 years old and did not even have a job at first. I point out subjects that I found to be noteworthy like choosing to work at retail jobs at maybe walmart, or something similar rather than starting as a fast food employee. 
                                    <br> <br> After that, I begin to talk about educational subjects that I need to address as I would have a plethora of work experience from working at different retail jobs, but what about professional experiences? Well in this section I define that I will have to mention my experience with coding languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. By mentioning this I hope to get a position as a front-end web developer at a company and continue to thrive, from there I can then get into more advanced coding techniques, which by the time I get the job I will start immediately to work towards a job at big tech companies.
                                    <br> <br> I then begin to talk about the future of this website explaining that I will "keep this seperate from my portfolio website". Obviously, things have changed and I discovered the purpose of home pages. As of now in Octobor 2020 I have not added links to my resume, professional email, or any way to contact me as a person at all within the home page. So it isn't really a portfolio website, but I add those things later on when my career in coding starts launching. 
                                </p>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <h3><button id="des_button" onclick="showy(des3)">-</button> College</h3>
                                <p class="hide" valueAsDes3>Here I begin to talk about advice for College like applying to Calfresh and being financially smart. I also split the two colleges I plan to go to splitting the two schools into their own categorey. I mainly point out the purpose of going to these schools, and the consequences that I may have to endure by moving foward. For example, I am well aware that I am using MJC as a way to give me two more years to prepare financially for UC Davis as I will be alone and on my own. A very scary future, but one that will lead to a brighter life.</p>

                </div>
                <div> <!--My Projects-->
                    <h2>My Projects</h2> 
                        <p>This is where I put my third final language to the test, Javascript. I am at the moment working on adding more, which will eventually be enitrely javascript based. Hopefully, I can add more diverse projects that rely on Javascript.</p>
                        <section>
                            <h3> <button id="des_button" onclick="showy(des4)">-</button>Unit Converter</h3>
                            <p class="hide" valueAsDes4>This is where I began to learn how tedious javascript can be due to the amount of functions I need for each unique situation, although, the code for the unit conversion was the best method I can implement for each conversion, which again was tedious. However, it did help me refine my ability to work with the button function that I struggled to implement on this page. Meanwhile, I also learned how to properly use arrays in a somewhat effective manner and by creating a reset button so recalculations are faster than deleting each value one by one. </p>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <h3> <button id="des_button" onclick="showy(des5)">-</button>Age Calculator</h3>
                            <p class="hide" valueAsDes5>This project is just as it's name suggests, it calculates your age when you give it a starting year and a final year. The real purpose of this project was to see how the class, constructor, and calling said class worked. It seems that I wouldn't have to be repetitive in coding javascript functions even though the age calculator would not have repeating code.</p>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <h3> <button id="des_button" onclick="showy(des6)" >-</button>Guess My Number</h3>
                            <p class="hide" valueAsDes6>I decided to use javascript more by expanding on my knowledge of how javascript would work by using logic and looping. In this game, the computer automatically chooses a random number depending on the mode you choose and as the name suggests, you have to guess for it. I may add more things like how many times you got something correct, although, that's the least of my concerns for now.</p>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <h3> <button id="des_button" onclick="showy(des7)">-</button> Check Calculator</h3>
                            <p class="hide" valueAsDes7>Here I added in something that is also javascript based. At this point, I am experimenting with DOM manipulation where I modify the attributes of elements within the page. It is also logic based as I used looping and various techniques to accomplish what I created, the Check Calculator.</p>
