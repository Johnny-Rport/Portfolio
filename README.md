# Portfolio Website
After a while, this website of mine is still not professional, and is very amateurish. However, as I'm getting there, my knowledge of JS has been growing, now instead of struggling with basic logic of JS I'm now entering DOM manipulation and am planning on expanding my knowledge of the language even further. I'll also try to branch to other coding languages if it helps with my understanding of coding in general and what to expect from each language. 

Most if not all my problems that I originally had has been fixed, even the linking system where I originally had to predict the url if it was in this site into my personal build  in order to make the linking work, however, I since fixed that and can now navigate my version as if it was a working build in this location.

I am far from an expert, but looking back, my understanding is vastly greater than when I only knew how to use HTML and CSS. Anyhoo [Here's the link to my website](https://johnnyportfolio.dev/)
