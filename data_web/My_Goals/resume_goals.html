    <body class="third_p">
        <div>
            <h1>What you need for a complete resume, work experience wise.</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>You shall get a job to put it into the resume experiences.</li>
                <li>You will continue to practice code languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order for it to be put into the resume.</li>
                <li>You will create and include various projects within your resume, like this basic website you have created, a portfolio website, and projects done on your own time.</li>
                <li>Projects could include games and apps done from scratch, look to youtube to find the projects that will appeal to employers. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>What you need for a complete resume, education wise.</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>You will obviously need a diploma, not for beginning jobs like retail.</li>
                <li>You can also have a Computer Science Degree after going to college to gain a <strong>competitive</strong> advantage.</li>
                <li>The above two are the main ones you need, but you can add to this by doing those nano-degrees to maybe gain an advantage? like the following:</li>
                <ol>    
                    <li>Codecademy</li>
                    <li>Udacity</li>
                    <li>Pretty sure there's more but I can only come up with those two.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Don't forget to mention your experience in code language, for example at this moment you have had about a week's worth of experience in HTML.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>The future of this primitive site.</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>For now its basically a poorly made website by the standards of the more complex ones. However, instead of turning this into your portfolio website like mention eariler, this instead will be a project example of you early days in coding.</li>
                <li>Your portfolio website will be coded seperate from this one, instead this will become a catalog of the code you can apply to future projects including the HTML and CSS code. Do your best to archive them all.</li>
                <li>While the next pages will be full of examples of what can be done that is not already shown in the first three pages, you will apply this knowledge to your portfolio website from the ground up.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>What your portfolio website would like.</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>You would need to include links to resume and professional email.</li>
                <li>Describe who you are and links to projects you have completed and current situation.</li>
                <li>It would not be a blog so you would not have to constantly add articles.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    </body>
