        <section>
            <p> I've been busy. I finally graduated from high school and am now moving onto college. However, before that, I shall work on improving my coding skills, specifically with Javascript. </p>
                
            <p> I'm going to refine the design of the website. I want to unify the theme across all of my projects. In the meanwhile, I'm also going to create a seperate page for this progress status to add in the navigation bar. </p>
                
            <p> Other than that, I have nothing else to say besides that I've been doing well and everything is going according to plan. My goal for now is to create numerous javascript projects. Soon that github code bar will have more Javascript than even html.</p>
