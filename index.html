        <div>
            <h1>What is this website you may ask?</h1>
            <article> 
                <p>This was my first project within the field of coding, these pages were purely made from scratch with html and CSS</p>
                <p>This is the home page that will lead to the other pages that will either go next or link back to this page. This home page is modeled after my older brother's personal blog and my high school's home page within their websites. <a href="https://raulingaverage.dev/" target="_blank">Here is my older brother's blog, he inspired me to do coding. </a> <a href="https://cvhsweb.ceres.k12.ca.us/" target="blank" style="color: red">Here is my high school's home page that I will model this home page after.</a></p>
                <p>Well it was my first project, my first baby steps into the coding world where I said "Hello World!". At the time of coding this sentence, I have turned that file into the first page (not the home page). I have created three more files at the time of coding this home page, one of those files being written in CSS language for style. Hopefully, I would also have a javascript file with this website in order to add some functionality like a couple of games if possible?</p>
                <p>That is what I hope that I can implement otherwise this is just a showcase of what I did in my early days like I mentioned. I don't know maybe I'll be able to refine it into something, animations might be good.</p>
                <p>Other than that once I'm finished with the home page I'll just make the pages more synthesized and ultimately make it more professional. Oh I just realized I could do an iframe for a javascript game if I can.</p>
                <p>Well that's the end of this description just practicing using the article tag within html as well as paragraph tags because I mostly used the list tags within the other pages which are about my future.</p>
            </article>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Links</h1>
            <article>
                <div>
                    <p>Now at the time of typing this paragraph I have successfully added a navigation bar with a animations and have the knowledge to change its appearance. Hopefully, by the time you're reading this I would have many more links to other projects I may have created. I think I know what this website would become, an archive of some sore where I experiment with and this home page will be the hub that connects all of my future projects. Very nice.</p>
                    <p>I guess I will elaborate the links that I have implmented into these paragraphs. Starting with my very first set of animated links</p>
                </div>
                <div> <!--My Goals-->
                    <h2>My Goals</h2>
                        <p>This is a categorey containing the first four webpages under the name of "My Goals" in the navigation bar. I have created that were mostly focused on refining my ability to implement code. I have had a successful experience just coding and adding on to what was supposed to be a "hello world!" program. It contains the following: Beginnings, Plans, Resume, and College. I will describe them in the next four sections in more detail, but essentially it is what I was thinking at the time of typing the code. Also, the descriptions show when the buttons are pressed.</p>
                        <section>
                            <h3> <button id="des_button" onclick="showy(showDes[0])">-</button> Beginnings</h3>
                                <p class="hide" valueAsDes0>So this was what I wrote and began to code immediately after getting my "hello world" program to work. Obviously, my first language is html so I understand basic coding and completely understand html to the point where I can create this website. I am getting more comfortable with css as well and as you can see, I am getting better at it as when comparing this page and the first page it is a marginal difference. 
                                <br> <br> I was thinking about what to do with the page because at the time I have created and successly added style to my first three pages and frankly they're quite bland in my opinion. However, that did not scare me to not learning more about coding and as I previously said I plan to turn this into an offical website where I store my projects into one hub. I believe my portfolio website once it is built will contain a link to this homepage. So basically I plan to build two seperate websites and linking one to the other for portfolio purposes. What will I do once I'm satisfied with my website? Well, I plan to add functionality to the website, like adding Javascript on here. I mostly plan to do small Javascript games like maybe tic tac toe as a starter and then moving from there.
                                <br> <br>Next within the page I then talk about my future, specifically college and my motives for doing so. So the major I will be taking to get a foot hold within the computing industry is Computer Science which as described within the page is just a set of classes that gives me a fancy degree to get more money. At this very moment, I am researching about the major and have found that it is just that, the school will not teach me everything about coding and how to get a stable career, so I will have to do it myself. I also noted the langauges they might use and the type of class it is, which is math heavy and I generally like math so hopefully the formulas aren't too complicated.
                                <br> <br>In the same page, I also talk about the languages I plan to learn in the future. I planned to learn html, css, and C++ for educational purposes. I am nearing the limits of both the html and css languages in terms of content, although I know most of their attributes and selections by heart I still cannot create cohesive websites without more experience, which is where implenting my newer projects into my this hub will be for (practice basically). </p>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <h3> <button id="des_button" onclick="showy(showDes[1])">-</button> Plans</h3>
                                <p class="hide" valueAsDes1>Here I begin list out my plans for the next three months starting in September. I have already completed most of my goals except for a few like knowing C++ or having an income at the time of 10/24/2020. However, my main goal to become comfortable with HTML, CSS, and Javascript was one of my most important goals and have been completed. I know enough html to type this paragraph and all the other text, and know enough CSS to achieve some form of style, as well creating button functions through Javascript, hopefully I had already created my next Javascript project by the time you're reading this.</p>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <h3><button id="des_button" onclick="showy(showDes[2])">-</button> Resume</h3>
                                <p class="hide" valueAsDes2>So within my resume page I talk about what I would need to put into my resume when I was about 17 years old and did not even have a job at first. I point out subjects that I found to be noteworthy like choosing to work at retail jobs at maybe walmart, or something similar rather than starting as a fast food employee. 
                                    <br> <br> After that, I begin to talk about educational subjects that I need to address as I would have a plethora of work experience from working at different retail jobs, but what about professional experiences? Well in this section I define that I will have to mention my experience with coding languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. By mentioning this I hope to get a position as a front-end web developer at a company and continue to thrive, from there I can then get into more advanced coding techniques, which by the time I get the job I will start immediately to work towards a job at big tech companies.
                                    <br> <br> I then begin to talk about the future of this website explaining that I will "keep this seperate from my portfolio website". Obviously, things have changed and I discovered the purpose of home pages. As of now in Octobor 2020 I have not added links to my resume, professional email, or any way to contact me as a person at all within the home page. So it isn't really a portfolio website, but I add those things later on when my career in coding starts launching. 
                                </p>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <h3><button id="des_button" onclick="showy(showDes[3])">-</button> College</h3>
                                <p class="hide" valueAsDes3>Here I begin to talk about advice for College like applying to Calfresh and being financially smart. I also split the two colleges I plan to go to splitting the two schools into their own categorey. I mainly point out the purpose of going to these schools, and the consequences that I may have to endure by moving foward. For example, I am well aware that I am using MJC as a way to give me two more years to prepare financially for UC Davis as I will be alone and on my own. A very scary future, but one that will lead to a brighter life.</p>

                </div>
                <div> <!--My Projects-->
                    <h2>My Projects</h2> 
                        <p>This is where I put my third final language to the test, Javascript. I am at the moment working on adding more, but the first three: Age Calculator, Unit Converter, and Real Calculator are the first three projects where it is Javascript based. Hopefully, as I learn new languages I can add more diverse projects that do not rely on Javascript.</p>
                        <section>
                            <h3> <button id="des_button" onclick="showy(showDes[4])">-</button>Age Calculator</h3>
                            <p class="hide" valueAsDes4>This was my very first try at coding Javascript, it is primitive and simple when comparing that to my later projects. However, it is also where I figured out how to get javascript to work without typing it in the index file so I still have my first lines of Javascript code in there but it has been set to a comment. Other than that, I also tried using the class method and handled coding objects, which was a new concept for me and I struggled getting the code to work. However, with research and learning I was able to figure out how to select the html elements, values, and perform certain actions like displaying the sum of two element values into a different element.</p>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <h3> <button id="des_button" onclick="showy(showDes[5])">-</button>Unit Converter</h3>
                            <p class="hide" valueAsDes5>This is where I began to learn how tedious javascript can be due to the amount of functions I need for each unique situation, although, the code for the unit conversion was the best method I can implement for each conversion, which again was tedious. However, it did help me refine my ability to work with the button function that I struggled to implement on this page. Meanwhile, I also learned how to properly use arrays in a somewhat effective manner and by creating a reset button so recalculations are faster than deleting each value one by one. </p>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <h3> <button id="des_button" onclick="showy(showDes[6])">-</button>Real Calculator</h3>
                            <p class="hide" valueAsDes6>Here I solve most of the problems that both the Age Calculator and Unit Converter presented: tediousness, unique situations, calculating multiple element values with operations, and how to delete values in a fast manner. This might be one of the few projects that I may update overtime although I highly doubt it. However, it is where I began to understand the class method from the Age Calculator, I have a feeling that this specific code will be useful in my early career in coding. I plan to implement this method of coding into more of my javascript projects in order to better prepare me for this type of assignment. </p>
                        </section>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Progress - January 2021</h2>
                        <p>Success! I have successfully fixed the file hierarchy and links within my website so all links should be working properly now. In addition, I have also managed to solve my javascript button problem and now two seperate buttons use the same function to work, without interrupting each other. It was a quick learning expeirence as I have also optimized it making my javascript code smaller. Since, those two were my main problems that are now fixed, I can now focus on my next project that will primarily utilize Javascript. Also, I will improve the web design of this website as some design choices are <em>questionable</em> like the font.
                            <br>
                            <br> I will make 2021 the year where I become an adult as I am 18 years old, and am turning 19 this year. I am not sure whether I will continue practicing the coding languages for front end web development like the infamous trio html, CSS, and Javascript, let alone if I learn a new language. I will try my best to continue learning the trio. I have taken a break during christmas, so hopefully I won't have to relearn my methods from the other months of me coding. If there is an ambition I am striving for, it is to create code for more complex applications. For now, I have no idea what I want to develop which will hinder my ability to learn how to code. At least I have an idea of where to develop my skills, I believe after I update this page I will begin to work on overhauling the design of this website and implementing more advanced methods of coding in order to create a smoother experience. Also, I plan to either change the college page or create an entire new category detailing my plans for my future. The newly created page will host the plan for my first year in college and the following years after. At the same time, I plan to implement for Javascript code than just HTML and CSS as I want to start created actual applications than just front end development.
